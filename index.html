      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p>
        By Evan Wild
        <br><br>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
        self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned
        documentary, The Jungle Book.
        <br><br>
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this
        article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Types of bear</h3>
      <p>
        <br><br>
        Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then
        it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        <br><br>
        Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in
        urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however, as you'll
        find out below. The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.
        <br><br>

      <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
      <p>
        <br><br>
        Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually growing ingredients. In general they
        will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from
        farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        <br><br>
        <img alt="Wild brown bear in the river" src="media/wild-bear.jpg">
        <br><br>
        Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban
        creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from readily
        available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban
        bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals,
        and microwave ovens.
        <br><br>
        <img alt="Urban bear seen in a zoo habitat" src="media/urban-bear.jpg">
        <br><br>
        Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonalds, to their own
        apartment.
        <br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
      <p>
        <br><br>
        Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of their
        lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with cave
        paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the case of
        an urban bear.
        <br><br>
        The following audio clip contains a fact file providing more details about bear mating rituals, along with
        samples and quotes from experts.

          once went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
          <br><br>
          He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound cool.

              <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
                little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in
                a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.</p>
